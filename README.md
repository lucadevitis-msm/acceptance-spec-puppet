# `msmfg_spec_helper`
## What is it?
It's a ruby gem whose purpose is to make it easyer to develop puppet modules
complieant to MSMFG guidelines. Other features are [coming soon](TODO.md)

## How do I install it?

### Requires
* `git`
* `ruby` (>= 2.1.5)
* `bundler` (to handle dependencies)

### Recommended
* `rvm`/`rbenv` (to handle multiple local version of `ruby`)
* `docker` (to run acceptance tests)

### Windows **WARNINGS**
* Be sure you install
  [DevKit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)
* `ruby-augeas` will **NOT** install

### Steps
```sh
gem install bundler
git clone https://github.com/lucadevitis-msm/msmfg_spec_helper
cd msmfg_spec_helper
bundle install
bundle exec rake validate install
```

## Logging and unified output
Each `rake` task, class or method in this library, logs messages through a
`::Logger` compliant class. Logs are displayed to screen but also turned into a
`JSON` document and sent to `Syslog` service. Few formatting extensions have
been implemented for common ruby ecosystem tools, in order to provide consistent,
unified and colored output. You can configure the logging behaviour with
environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` by setting it to one of the following strings
as threshold:

* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `FATAL`
* `UNKNOWN`

By default, logging has a threshold level of `WARN`, and does not print
anything out.

## `msmfg-puppet-module-create`

It actually is a `rake` application that accepts a `help` task. All standard
`rake` options are also available.

### Can create an entire module skeleton from scratch
If you want to create a brand new module, you can use `msmfg-create-module`. You have 3 options:
Using environment variable `MODULE_NAME`
```sh
MODULE_NAME=puppet-something msmfg-puppet-module-create
```
Using rake argument variable `MODULE_NAME`
```sh
msmfg-puppet-module-create MODULE_NAME=puppet-something
```
Letting `msmfg-puppet-module-create` to guess the module's name from the current working directory
```sh
$ mkdir puppet-something
$ cd puppet-something
$ msmfg-puppet-module-create
```
Example output:
```
$ LOG_LEVEL=INFO LOG_PERROR=1 msmfg-puppet-module-create
luca@centos6:/tmp/puppet-something$ LOG_LEVEL=INFO msmfg-puppet-module-create
I: create: metadata.json: OK
I: create: manifests: OK
I: create: manifests/init.pp: OK
I: create: .fixtures.yml: OK
I: create: Rakefile: OK
I: create: Gemfile: OK
I: create: Gemfile.lock: OK
I: create: spec/acceptance/nodesets: OK
I: create: spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml: OK
I: create: spec/spec_helper.rb: OK
I: create: spec/spec_helper_acceptance.rb: OK
I: create: spec/classes: OK
I: create: spec/classes/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
I: create: spec/acceptance/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
```

### Can add missing files to an already existsing module
If you already have a module and you want to let this gem fill the gap, you can just run the `msmfg-puppet-module-create` command.
The script will not override existing files. `msmfg-puppet-module-create` will try to guess the module name from the `metadata.json`
file or current working directory basename.
```sh
$ cd /path/to/your/puppet-something
$ msmfg-create-module
```

### Will add basic catalogue and acceptance specs
The script will take care of creating `spec/spec_helper.rb`, `spec/spec_helper_acceptance` and
`spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml` for you. Gven a module name like `puppet-something`, the
script will also:

1. Create a basic catalogue spec `spec/classes/something_spec.rb` that is supposed to test the catalogue compilation.
2. Create a basic acceptance spec `spec/acceptance/something_spec.rb` that will try to apply the class manifest, twice.

Automatic guess of requirements is on the way. In the mean while you have to configure
[`.fixtures.yaml`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper#using-fixtures)

## `msmfg-puppet-module-validate`

It actually is a `rake` application that accepts a `help` task. All standard
`rake` options are also available.

### Can validate the module
You can validate the current module against the currently implemented MSMFG acceptance specs for puppet modules:
```
$ LOG_LEVEL=INFO msmfg-puppet-module-validate
I: syntax: Gemfile: OK
I: syntax: Rakefile: OK
I: syntax: spec/acceptance/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
I: syntax: spec/classes/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
I: syntax: spec/spec_helper.rb: OK
I: syntax: spec/spec_helper_acceptance.rb: OK
I: syntax: manifests/init.pp: OK
I: syntax: metadata.json: OK
I: lint: metadata.json: OK
I: lint: manifests/init.pp: OK
I: lint: Gemfile: OK
I: lint: Rakefile: OK
I: lint: spec/acceptance/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
I: lint: spec/classes/ifetoolbelt_spec.rb: OK
I: lint: spec/spec_helper.rb: OK
I: lint: spec/spec_helper_acceptance.rb: OK
I: docs: manifests/init.pp: OK
```

#### Check syntax
Check any sort of syntax:
```sh
$ msmfg-puppet-module-validate syntax
```
You could also check specific a type of syntax:
```
$ msmfg-puppet-module-validate syntax:ruby
```

#### Check ruby style
```sh
$ msmfg-puppet-module-validate ruby_style
```

#### Check manifests style
```sh
$ msmfg-puppet-module-validate puppet_style
```

#### Runs MSMFG acceptance spes for Puppet Modules
```sh
$ msmfg-puppet-module-validate msmfg_acceptance_spec
Puppet module "skeleton"
  File "metadata.json"
    should be file
    metadata

## No-brainer Rakefile
There are multiple task libraries that you could `require` in your `Rakefile`:

* `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_module`: loads/configure any possible task
  * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_module/create`: defines files/directories creation tasks
  * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_module/validate`: loads all validation tasks:
    * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/syntax`: see above
    * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_style`: see above
    * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/ruby_style`: see above
    * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/docs_coverage`: see above
  * `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_module/spec`: defines puppet specs and acceptance specs tasks
* `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/syntax`: defins all syntax checking tasks
* `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_style`: defines the puppet style checking task
* `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/ruby_style`: defines the ruby style checking task
* `msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/docs_coverage`: defines the documentation coverage checking task

When you create the `Rakefile` with `msmfg-puppet-module-create`, it will look like
```ruby
require 'msmfg_spec_helper/rake_tasks/puppet_module'
```

## No-brainer gems bundle
If you write your `Gemfile` like:
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'msmfg_spec_helper'
```
and run `bundle install` this gem will require all the goodies you might need
to develop your module (currently around 139 gems).

When you create the `Gemfile` with `msmfg-puppet-module-create`, it will look
liket the example above.

## No-brainer spec helpers
If you write yout `specs/spec_helper.rb` like:
```ruby
require 'msmfg_spec_helper/puppet_module/spec_helper_acceptance'
```
and your `specs/spec_helper_acceptance.rb` like:
```ruby
require 'msmfg_spec_helper/puppet_module/spec_helper'
```
Those 2 `ruby` libs will take care of the specs configuration

When you create the `specs/spec_helper.rb` and
`specs/spec_helper_acceptance.rb` with `msmfg-puppet-module-create`, they will
look liket the examples above.
